        <p class="lead">Think back over your life. Think about the people that had a positive influence on you. If your past was like mine, many of them didnâ€™t realize the impact they made. The influence was usually due to them caring about you and doing some little thing. What little things have been done for you that changed your life? What little things have you done for someone else that might have changed theirs?</p>
